# Yelyp ---> Generates Restaurant Reviews Instantly!
Yelpy is a Next.js app that lets you generate fun, realistic-looking reviews for any restaurant using AI.

## Goal:
- Our plan is to allow people to generate reviews for their very own restaurant!

## Features:
- Enter your restaurant's menu, name, and cuisine.
- Choose positive or negative reviews.
- Generate 1-10 reviews at one time, instantly.

## How to Use:
1. Paste a portion of your menu into the first box.
2. Enter the restaurant name and cuisine.
3. Toggle the sentiment bar to positive or negative.
4. Pick how many reviews you want (1–10).
5. Click **Generate Reviews** to see them appear on the right.

## Instructions to Run Locally:
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
